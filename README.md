# usefull_graphs_for_data_science

## In here is where I saved for myself a few useful graphs for future 

We got here three main notebooks for future use.

### 1) mathplotlib

Here we can see a few kinds of graphs:
	1) regular graphs
	2) Multi-plot
	3) Object-Oriented
	4) Subplot object-oriented method
	5) working with Titles and legends
	6) Control over axis appearance
	7) Plot types
	8) Advanced Matplotlib
	9) Text annotation
	10) Colormap and contour figures
	11) bonus - 3D-Figures

### 2) seaborn
	1) a few different variations of graphs
	2)  Matrix Plots
	3) working with Grid
	4) Regrassions


### 3) Plotly

	1) different graphs variations + 3d models
	2) Geographical Plotting

#### note: unfortunately, out of the more excellent graphs in Ploty cost money, so I didnâ€™t unlock them yet; I may be adding in the Further
